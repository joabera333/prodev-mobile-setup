# Project Reset

This project includes a reset script to clean and restore the development environment to a fresh state. This is particularly useful when facing:

- Persistent Metro bundler errors
- Native build issues (iOS/Android)
- Dependency conflicts
- Unexplained caching problems

## ðŸš€ Quick Reset

Run the following command:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```
